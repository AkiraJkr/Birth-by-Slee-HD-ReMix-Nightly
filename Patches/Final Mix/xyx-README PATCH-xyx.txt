---- BEFORE APPLYING THE PATCH ----

MAKE A BACKUP.

------ APPLYING THE PATCH ------

Open xdeltaUI.exe, select the Patch, then your KHBBS Final Mix .iso, and then, where you want to drop the modified .iso


(No promises that this works on non-Final Mix)
PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS FOLDER, OR SOME TEXTURES WON'T WORK.
