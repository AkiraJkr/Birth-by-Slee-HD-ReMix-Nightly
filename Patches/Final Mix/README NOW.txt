------ APPLYING THE PATCH ------

Open xdelta.exe(wip)

------ AFTER YOU'RE DONE ------

Go to the folder Manual Patching for users, and extract all the contents to the main folder of the project. It should automatically fix all textures that needed changes after patching.


(No promises that this works on non-Final Mix)
PLEASE DON'T DELETE THIS FOLDER, OR SOME TEXTURES WON'T WORK.
